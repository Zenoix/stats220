# Jeff Wang's Stats220 Repo

## What is this Repo For?
This repository is for containing files that I create and use in my **Stats220** course here at the University of Auckland. Stats220 is about data technologies which is pretty much how data scientists use technology to do _data sciency things_ I guess ðŸ˜…. We learn topics such as:
- R programming
- Data collection
- Data cleaning
- Data storage
- SQL and databases
- Basic web development skills
- and more

More info about the course can be found [here](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213). 

This repo also holds files that are used in a github pages I made for this repository and for the course. So files that I create can be displayed on the github page. Link for the **[website can be found here](https://zenoix.github.io/stats220/)**.

Hopefully me at the end of the course:

## Why Did I Make this Repo?
Well, the main reason I made this repo was because it's required for the course's first assignment (_but let's pretend I actually wanted to create this ðŸ˜‰_). Other than that, it's a way to display and store what I learn in the course, both in github and also on a github page.

Anyways, it's time for me to bounce. Come back once in a while and see if there are any new cool things. See ya later!
